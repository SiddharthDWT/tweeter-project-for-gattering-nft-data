1044,2022-02-11 21:49:22+00:00,capsule_house,"10/ How could weak humans capture the Yokai, the ones who hatched first, the ones with calamitous power?"
1045,2022-02-11 21:49:21+00:00,capsule_house,"9/ Then the humans appeared. Oka-san says humans are weak. They are weak because they die, and so they live in constant fear of a thing they do not understand. I have never met a human, but they don’t sound weak to me."
1046,2022-02-11 21:49:21+00:00,capsule_house,"8/ The world was chaos and disorder. Then the Yokai opened their eyes, and their beauty calmed the waters. The rivers returned to their beds. The mountains, feeling shame, found their dignity and drew up to their full height. The world was quiet.”"
1047,2022-02-11 21:49:21+00:00,capsule_house,"7/ “In the beginning there were four species, and the Yokais hatched first. The land and the water shook with their calamitous power. Mountains broke apart like brittle leaves. Flowing rivers separated like strands of windblown hair and washed over the green fields."
1048,2022-02-11 21:49:20+00:00,capsule_house,6/ Oka-san says that Yokai is an old and special word. It is a special word because it contains two powerful energies: attraction and repulsion. Beauty and disaster.
1049,2022-02-11 21:49:20+00:00,capsule_house,5/ What if we decided to walk on our own? What if we decided to dance? What if we decided to leave? Too ugly. I wish I understood ugliness.
1050,2022-02-11 21:49:20+00:00,capsule_house,"4/ Sometimes I am scared of being left behind. Oka-san says that one day she will make me feet but that feet are strange and often ugly, too ugly for the Yokai, the ones who hatched first. Too ugly, too ugly, she says."
1051,2022-02-11 21:49:19+00:00,capsule_house,"3/ Or a colorful toy. Or an old song. There are many parts of me in here that are very, very lost. I wonder, too: if we are her children, does that mean I have brothers and sisters? Do they know about me? Are they looking for me? Have they hatched?"
1052,2022-02-11 21:49:19+00:00,capsule_house,"2/ She says we are her lovely children. When she speaks to me her hair floats across my eyes and her breath collects all around me. It feels like I am floating in her voice. Often, as I drift, I wonder if it is true – if we are children. I feel more like a piece of clothing."
1053,2022-02-11 21:49:19+00:00,capsule_house,"1/ ""In the beginning, there were four species, and the Yokais hatched first...""

This is the story I have been buried with. Oka-san whispers the words. “In the beginning...the Yokais hatched first...” This is her memory, and also her prophecy."

2053,2021-12-13 20:13:19+00:00,capsule_house,"Q: Why doesn’t this project have more steam? 

A: People will come and go. Hard to find the gems, but this is a long term play here. Market is not rewarding A-List art. We have high quality ideas coming -- don't think any other project has anything of this type."
2054,2021-12-13 20:13:19+00:00,capsule_house,"Q: Could you guys explain a bit more about the future value of the Zodiac Capsules? Will there be any special benefits of holding an entire set of the 12 Zodiac Capsules?

A: Good times are coming for sure."
2055,2021-12-13 20:13:18+00:00,capsule_house,"Q: Does the team like the idea of tokens? 

A: We have played around with it but ultimately we want to find other ways to reward holders without the use of tokens for a variety of reasons."
2056,2021-12-13 20:13:18+00:00,capsule_house,"Q: Can you tell us more about the @LivesOfAsuna collaboration?

A: @ZumiDraws is a good friend. We lended some Capsule House IP in exchange for WL spots if that interests you. We're going to be thoughtful but diligent in offering future WL opps."
2057,2021-12-13 20:13:18+00:00,capsule_house,"Q: When is Capsule House going to be an animated TV series or feature film?

A: We're building a world where our IP is used for interesting things - this all comes back to the IP. Multiyear vision."
2058,2021-12-13 20:13:17+00:00,capsule_house,"Q: Should I leave a capsule on a nifty gateway?

A: No you should not leave a capsule on nifty. It will not qualify towards the 30+ days holder’s raffle due the nature of nifty’s ‘wallet’."
2059,2021-12-13 20:13:17+00:00,capsule_house,"Q: Layer 2 Thoughts/Strategy?

A: Has to fill in an actual technical point for us. If there's anything cool we can pull from Layer2, please let us know."
2060,2021-12-13 20:13:17+00:00,capsule_house,"Q: Seerlight, how accurate is the transition usually between creation in the mind and transference to artwork?

A: Before I start I have a clear picture, but some are lost in translation. As the process goes on, I add on to it so that they come out the same or even better."
2061,2021-12-13 20:13:16+00:00,capsule_house,"Q: Any efforts on building community engagement with each other vs. with the Capsule House team? 

A: Capsule Council will be the first branch of this. Want conversations to be more than just speculation of how to improve the community."
2062,2021-12-13 20:13:16+00:00,capsule_house,"Q: Will the 3D models be chibi avatars, rigged and animated? Or is it more bringing of Seerlights worlds to life in 3D?

A: More the former, something usable in games or whatever the next big thing is. The 3D model is of the capsule character. PFP will have a more mature look."
2063,2021-12-13 20:13:15+00:00,capsule_house,"Q: Do you guys have any plans with integrating capsules into www3?

A: Will reach out. A lot of stuff is going into 3D and we are in the process of working on 3D assets, so you can be represented later on in the future. All about future proofing."
2064,2021-12-13 20:13:15+00:00,capsule_house,"Q: Can you guys explain more about the Seerlight Art Installations on the Roadmap?

A: Holders will be given the opportunity to see how amazing their art is. They are the best kept secret of blue chip art right now. More opportunities to expand on this as covid gets better."
2065,2021-12-13 20:13:14+00:00,capsule_house,"Q: Seer had mentioned possibly rewarding minters who never sold. Still something that could happen?

A: Could definitely happen. :)"
2066,2021-12-13 20:13:14+00:00,capsule_house,"Q: Any plans in the future #CapsuleVerse for mythic capsules?

A: Yes! There will be a couple additional features to reward those holding a capsule with a mythic trait."
2067,2021-12-13 20:13:14+00:00,capsule_house,"Q: What is the possibility of staking Capsules and a token with no financial value?

A: Not an efficient way of distribution, no need to make you guys stake to claim."
2068,2021-12-13 20:13:13+00:00,capsule_house,"Q: oksami, how many other projects are you working on at once?

A: Acting dev for a few other projects, working on sales infrastructure and contract development. Capsule House is my number 1 priority."
2069,2021-12-13 20:13:13+00:00,capsule_house,"Q: Seerlight, how many other projects are you working on at once?

A: Small art projects and collars, but Capsule House is my baby."
2070,2021-12-13 20:13:12+00:00,capsule_house,"Q: Anything we feel we will be innovators in?

A: Yes - morphing between Capsule to Avatar. Nothing close to the level of quality and scale we are going to embark on. More than enough talent to execute this. Not going to be another 10K PFP drop."
2071,2021-12-13 20:13:12+00:00,capsule_house,"Q: Is this a “burn” for a PFP? Otherwise does this not just dilute the market? 

A: Finalizing mechanisms but we're not planning on burning the PFP. Instead, morph your capsules around by changing how they are displayed. Scheme where you can keep both. Not going to be diluted."
2072,2021-12-13 20:13:12+00:00,capsule_house,"Q: When can we expect the PFPs to hatch in 2022?

A: Targeting for the first batch in mid to late January. Batch rollout pace is TBD."
2073,2021-12-13 20:13:11+00:00,capsule_house,"Q: What is it in particular that inspired/continues to inspire the art style that Seerlight creates? 

A: Mostly Ghibli movies. Especially ""Spirited Away."""
2074,2021-12-13 20:13:10+00:00,capsule_house,"Q: Seerlight, What do you do to get into your “creative zone”? 

A: I usually start after midnight and after I finish everything else I needed to do for the day. I turn on music or play games before I start working, which is every day."
2075,2021-12-13 20:13:10+00:00,capsule_house,"Q: Seerlight, Where do you get the most inspiration for your art? 

A: I'm inspired by Asian architecture -- Chinese and Japanese temples. I really look up to Yuumei."
2076,2021-12-13 20:13:10+00:00,capsule_house,"Q: Seerlight, what was your journey like? 

A: I started 8 years ago on deviant art, but just about 3 years ago I started to post on IG and grew a following there. Started with painting style and transitioned to line art, which is how I came upon his current style now."

2367,2021-10-05 21:46:50+00:00,capsule_house,"4) We ended up developing an in-house k-means clustering algorithm to sort each character into its most prominent color groups.

2418,2021-10-02 17:03:24+00:00,capsule_house,"9)

There was also a more expensive call once you had connected your wallet that would fetch how many Capsules you had already minted. This should have been called from the client's browser instead of our server. The load test wouldn't catch this as it just queried the site."
2419,2021-10-02 17:03:23+00:00,capsule_house,"8)

Addressing server load:

The night before, we tested about 10,000 users hitting the site in a minute. This is about 166 queries per second, which probably doesn't model the actual load as everyone is going to be hitting the site instantly."
2420,2021-10-02 17:03:23+00:00,capsule_house,"7)

...and the team agreed. We decided to to force users to mint only from the site after a captcha to mitigate this. It actually worked quite well and we still stand by this decision despite the server issues, as no one competed against a bot."

Why did you guys not allow mint from contract?

The original public sale was planned to be a first come first serve sale with a maximum of 10 mints per wallet and allowed mint from contract. Two days before public sale, the community expressed concerns about botting..."
2422,2021-10-02 17:03:23+00:00,capsule_house,"5)

Can you change the metadata on the tokens?

Currently, yes. In fact, we have to do one more update because the metadata is using a IPFS gateway that allows Capsules to be revealed faster and we'll need to move off that. We will then transfer ownership to 0x0 to freeze it."
2423,2021-10-02 17:03:22+00:00,capsule_house,"4)

How does the presale function prevent people from minting from contract?

Your address gets a special signature from us that only your address can use. If you don't get that signature, you'll have no idea what to put into the mint function and will get rejected."
2424,2021-10-02 17:03:22+00:00,capsule_house,"3)

Was it possible to use the public mint functions on the contract?

No. We never actually used the public mint function as the ""public sale"" was never opened. We re-used the presale code to funnel users into using a captcha."
2425,2021-10-02 17:03:22+00:00,capsule_house,"2)

Why does the team have so many capsules, including the rare Nurarihyons?

Aside from #1, #2, and #3, which are team avatars, the Nurarihyons and the other capsules in the team account are reserved for giveaways and future events."
2426,2021-10-02 17:03:22+00:00,capsule_house,"1)

First off - addressing a few common questions:

Was it possible to identify rarer capsules before the reveal?

No. The revealed metadata wasn't set on the contract until... the reveal. If you tried to look for metadata on the contract before that you would see nothing."
2427,2021-10-02 17:03:21+00:00,capsule_house,"gm everyone!

2480,2021-09-26 07:09:37+00:00,capsule_house,"Well. Our presale filled in less than 15 minutes, broke our submission bot, and our Discord doubled in size to over 1,000 members. That's a pretty good Saturday night.

We're actively discussing increasing presale slot limits, so please continue to register if you're interested!"

2487,2021-09-24 17:46:43+00:00,capsule_house,@ApplesAndBerry That's still a go as soon as we deploy! And to clarify - it's a raffle giveaway - it's not to everyone but selected amongst a few winners through over everyone who entered.
2488,2021-09-24 17:30:52+00:00,capsule_house,"And as of this morning, all our Capsules are finalized and ready to go!

Keep your eyes peeled for presale registration later this weekend on our Discord. Whitelisted users can mint anytime 48 hours before the public sale. No gas wars means happy minting!

2497,2021-09-21 22:50:08+00:00,capsule_house,"Lastly, over 140 additional traits were hand drawn to accessorize each Capsule. This is the most ""generative"" portion of the Capsule as we assign each Capsule its own set of accessories.

We certainly hope you feel the love and care put into every one of these!"
2498,2021-09-21 22:47:21+00:00,capsule_house,"That's over 120 unique base character designs. 

Clothing, body and animal parts, hairstyles, etc. are not generated but in fact custom made for each character. 

An additional 20 color variants are created for each character as well. These are all hand shaded."
2499,2021-09-21 22:45:33+00:00,capsule_house,"It's a good sign when we get asked where the generated Capsules are because everything looks hand drawn.

These are already generated!

To be fair, we can't blame you for not being able to tell.
