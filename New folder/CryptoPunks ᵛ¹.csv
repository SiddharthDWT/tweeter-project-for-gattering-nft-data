While the V1s still exist in their original form, so does the existing bug in the V1 contract, so NEVER put an unwrapped V1 on sale as you will most likely loose it.

But what does it mean to wrap an NFT?
When you wrap, you deposit the NFT into another smart contract. Allowing it to be traded on secondary markets such as opensea and fixes any bugs on the original NFT contract.

To fix this bug, Cryptopunks v1 wrapper was born, making it safe to trade on secondary marketplaces.

762,2022-03-28 14:30:59+00:00,v1punks,"In the original Cryptopunks smart contract, there was a code error that caused Ethereum to be allocated to the buyer instead of the seller when a purchase was made. In other words, a buyer was immediately refunded for their purchase and was able to keep the Punk.
