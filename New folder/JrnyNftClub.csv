It's funny that someone with his platform cares so much though and gets so sensitive. He even blocks and kicks out his VIP members who paid him $1k each."
1,2021-11-21 03:59:49+00:00,JrnyNftClub,It's a shame you get blocked or removed from his discord if you even question him or his project with valid uncertainties. It's definitely a totalitarian vibe. I heard you do it to your VIP members too.. It's sad a grown man with this following can't accept constructive criticism https://t.co/DT2EAPH1oZ
