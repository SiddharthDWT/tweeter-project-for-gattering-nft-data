1523,2021-09-25 04:45:44+00:00,nftworldsNFT,"What will NFT worlds look like?

See the example NFT worlds attached! https://t.co/nk8lGZTOJ5"
1524,2021-09-25 04:45:43+00:00,nftworldsNFT,"How will I build in my NFT World?

NFT Worlds are intentionally compatible with Minecraft - At this time, the most direct way for us to provide building capabilities is through the Minecraft client &amp; dApp that connects to it to allow on-chain world sync. (More on this later!)"
1525,2021-09-25 04:45:42+00:00,nftworldsNFT,"How will I explore my NFT World?

We'll be providing a handful of dApps shortly after initial mint.

These initial dApps include a world browser (See all worlds, filter by rarity/attributes / etc) and an in-browser world explorer (Walk around worlds WASD style)

1526,2021-09-25 04:45:42+00:00,nftworldsNFT,"I have some great ideas for NFT Worlds, will I be able to build on top of the NFT Worlds project?

Absolutely! You'll be able to do whatever you'd like with your world, and with the NFT Worlds project. We're excited to see community members developing their own ideas."
1527,2021-09-25 04:45:42+00:00,nftworldsNFT,"How much will it cost to mint an NFT World?

We want to build a thriving, autonomous, distributed and decentralized virtual worlds ecosystem, not a quick shill/cash grab.

We're internally debating a mint price between 0 eth (Just pay gas) and 0.1 eth + gas. 

#nftmint #mintalert"
1528,2021-09-25 04:45:41+00:00,nftworldsNFT,"When's the initial mint date? How many NFT Worlds will be made available?

10,000 NFT Worlds will be available to mint starting October 5th. Join our discord (https://t.co/M7jVPAghXb) to stay up to date with the latest on the project.

1529,2021-09-25 04:45:41+00:00,nftworldsNFT,"What's the long term plan for NFT Worlds?

We want NFT Worlds to be a truly open, autonomously developed, decentralized virtual worlds platform driven by the community. We'll provide as much open ended tools as possible for interacting with each world. You take it from there."
1530,2021-09-25 04:45:41+00:00,nftworldsNFT,"Are worlds stored on-chain?

Because world data files are very large, they aren't stored on chain, but a world's unique attributes, resource distributions and features are.

World data files, rarity distribution files and more will be made available shortly after initial mint."
1531,2021-09-25 04:45:40+00:00,nftworldsNFT,"Am I limited by what I can do with NFT Worlds, or my NFT world?

Absolutely not! We're building a baseline idea for the community to autonomously build spin experiences, new ideas and more on top of. Do whatever you want with your NFT World or the NFT Worlds project."
1532,2021-09-25 04:45:40+00:00,nftworldsNFT,"What can I do with an NFT World?

NFT worlds will be explorable in first person and can be built, shared with others, or sold on secondary after building exciting structures within your world and adding creative value.

#nftworlds #nftworld #virtualworlds #metaverse #crypto"
1533,2021-09-25 04:45:40+00:00,nftworldsNFT,"Are there rarities? How do they work?

Yes! There are hundreds of unique attributes across all 10,000 NFT Worlds. Some much rarer than others. Rarities can apply to geographical attributes, the environments that make up a given world, resource distributions and unique features."
1534,2021-09-25 04:45:39+00:00,nftworldsNFT,"What is an NFT World?

Each NFT World is a completely unique voxel based world (partly off-chain), generated with its own set of properties (on-chain). 

All worlds are vastly unique across their geography, resource composition and unique features."
