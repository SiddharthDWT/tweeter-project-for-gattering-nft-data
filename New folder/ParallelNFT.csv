I'll dig up the thread for you. 🤝
2135,2022-05-03 00:52:39+00:00,ParallelNFT,@AlexMetaverse @ColinLieb It uses Chainlink VRF to prove the packs are generated randomly so the reservations can’t be gamed nor front ran.

2309,2022-04-19 18:44:46+00:00,ParallelNFT,Please note that the numbers are placeholders to demonstrate the idea and further updates will follow as we explore the engineering side of this further.
2310,2022-04-19 18:44:46+00:00,ParallelNFT,"In short, our community is the retailer and distributor who will meet the demand for cards beyond the First Edition. There is nuance and further work to do here but this is the card population management system we look to implement."
2311,2022-04-19 18:44:45+00:00,ParallelNFT,"The above model gives everyone a look at what this could function like with placeholder numbers, and demonstrates some of the possible exciting permutations and anomolies that could occur when spawning - glitch cards, logo mark cards, and multiples."
2312,2022-04-19 18:44:45+00:00,ParallelNFT,Why would the new players who don’t have NFTs want to buy cards? Because when they play with apparitions they will see what their Prime emissions WOULD be had they won the match with an NFT deck - offering an incentive structure to acquire the cards going forward.
2313,2022-04-19 18:44:45+00:00,ParallelNFT,Players earn Prime [ERC20] and Renown for winning matches of Parallel. The Prime and Renown is then used to create more cards that can be sold to people who want them.
2314,2022-04-19 18:44:44+00:00,ParallelNFT,Lineage achieves this by making the community the printer and retailer of cards for anyone who doesn’t have them once the game is live.
2315,2022-04-19 18:44:44+00:00,ParallelNFT,"To avoid this, the Lineage System offers a way to connect the desire for liquidity with new card demand while not requiring you to sell your First Edition cards."
2316,2022-04-19 18:44:44+00:00,ParallelNFT,"We have seen the model of a token acting as liquidity but this is problematic, as it puts sell pressure on the network value."
2317,2022-04-19 18:44:43+00:00,ParallelNFT,"At the completion of the Base Set, the community of card holders will be the only ones who can create new cards to meet demand when the game is live.
If you have a card, you’re probably attached to it and want to keep it, but you also want liquidity."
